# Designing Platform 
## Approach 1
### Idea
- Using large (wide) crafts sticks 
- Layer to reduce space between servo head and platform 
    - Using cardboard? More sticks?
- Hot Glue? Tape? 
- Drill hole through middle for screw (7/64 bit for M3 Screw)

### Issues
- Not Sturdy 
- Long Process (Measuring + Cutting so many sticks to size)
- Using Glue 
    - Glue layers as well -> Platform is not straight 
    - As result -> Camera does not sit straight
- Need a LOT of sticks to layer to desired thickness 
- Cardboard also weak

## Approach 2 
### Idea
- Block of Wood
- Cut to desired base/platform size 
- Easy to stack or just get desired thickness of platform 
- Measurements:
    - L = 3.5in 
    - W/H = 2.5in (or 2in -> will finalize later)
    - Thickness:
        - Space available under head of screw = 1.4cm 
        - Hex Nut Width: 0.2cm 
        - Option 1: 1.2cm - 1.3cm wood thickness? Without hex nut (almost no space left)
        - Option 2: 1.0cm - 1.1cm WITH Hex Nut (small amount of space left)
        - Option 3: Dig hex nut into platform bottom (almost no space left -> possibly more secure)

### Issues
- Unsure of how much weight servo can support (before motor gives out)
- Unsure if platform is meant to sit so close to the head of the servo
- Is it okay to put a hex nut on the head of the servo
